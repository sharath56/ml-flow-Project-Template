# MLflow Project Template

This is a fully automated MLflow project scaffold designed for MLOps workflows.  
It provides a standardized directory structure, starter files, and automation to jump-start your machine learning project with best practices.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Install the CLI tool

If you have this tool packaged as a Python package (e.g., `mlflow-init`), install it with:

pip install mlflow-init

````

Or, if you have the `cli.py` script, run it directly with:

```bash
python cli.py <project-name>
```

### Create a new project

Generate a new MLflow MLOps project with:

```bash
mlflow-init my_mlops_project
```

This will create the folder `my_mlops_project/` with the full MLOps-ready structure.

## 📄 Key Files Explained

* **MLproject**:
  Defines the MLflow project entry points, parameters, and conda environment.
  This file enables running your project with `mlflow run`.

* **conda.yaml**:
  Conda environment specification to create reproducible environments.

* **run.sh**:
  Convenience script to run MLflow project with default parameters.

* **src/train.py**:
  Example training script that accepts CLI arguments (`--epochs`, `--batch_size`).

* **notebooks/train\_and\_log.ipynb**:
  Notebook for prototyping model training and logging with MLflow.

* **ml\_models/**:
  Folder where trained models should be saved for deployment or versioning.

* **tests/**:
  Contains test scripts to validate your codebase integrity.

* **configs/default.yaml**:
  Place to store configurable hyperparameters or settings in YAML format.

* **scripts/download\_data.sh**:
  Sample shell script to automate dataset download or preparation.

* **docker/**:
  Contains Dockerfile and Kubernetes manifest to containerize and deploy the project.

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. **Create and activate conda environment:**

```bash
conda env create -f conda.yaml
conda activate mlflow-env
```

2. **Run training with MLflow:**

```bash
mlflow run . -P epochs=10 -P batch_size=64
```

Or use the convenience script:

```bash
./run.sh
```

3. **Develop**

* Add your data processing code in `src/data/`
* Define models in `src/models/`
* Use `notebooks/` for experimentation
* Save models to `ml_models/`
* Write tests in `tests/`

4. **Automate**

* Use `scripts/` for data pipeline automation
* Use `docker/` to build and deploy containers in production

---

## 🧪 Testing

Run tests with your preferred test runner, e.g., `pytest`:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

---

## 📦 Packaging & Deployment

* Containerize your app using the Dockerfile in `docker/`
* Deploy to Kubernetes using the manifest file

---

## 🔧 Customize

Feel free to modify any files or folder structures to better fit your project needs. This template serves as a starting point to help you follow MLOps best practices and speed up development.
